HYPERMESH_MESHING_STRATEGY = """
HyperMesh meshing strategy for this workstation:

1. Do not use solidmap for this workflow.
2. Use the existing b.hm-style size scale as the reference. For surface-deviation
   triangular surface mesh, use parameters close to: growth rate 1.23,
   minimum element size 0.5, maximum deviation 0.1, maximum feature angle 15,
   mesh type R-trias.
3. Tetra-volume parts must be meshed per object/component. Do not dump tetra
   elements from several objects into another component.
4. Flanges are tetra parts, not drag parts. A flange with bolt holes, stepped
   lips, bosses, or local cutouts must use surface-deviation R-trias followed
   by tetramesh, even if part of its outline looks circular.
5. For tetra strategy: first make 2D surface-deviation R-trias mesh, check/fix
   2D aspect > 10, then generate volume mesh with tetramesh, then check/fix
   volume skew > 0.99.
6. For simple straight tube/cylinder drag hex meshing, match logical edge seed
   counts, but do not blindly promote the whole source face to the largest outer
   edge count. If preview seed counts or edge lengths differ greatly, choose a
   balanced common count from the section scale (geometric-mean style) and use
   that one count for the mapped source face. Continue only when the source face
   is a mapped, 100% quad mesh. If that cannot be guaranteed, try a spin-hex
   strategy for suitable revolved bodies, otherwise fall back to tetra. The
   generated workflow must validate that real 3D hex elements were created; a
   leftover 2D section alone is a failure.
7. For obvious revolved bodies, prefer spin meshing, but never invent the
   section from guessed radii or from a side/end face. First split the solid with
   a real middle cutting plane, use only the newly created surfaces that lie on
   that cutting plane as 2D section sources, mesh one section surface, then spin
   it to 3D. The section mesh may be mixed, but its size is chosen and checked
   from the actual section dimensions; if the section mesh is too coarse, clean
   up temporary shells and fall back to the tetra strategy.
8. Try a structured hex route before tetra when the geometry supports it:
   drag for simple constant-section extrusions and cut-section spin for
   revolved solids.
   If the chosen hex route fails validation, fall back to tetra for that object.
   Clean bearing/ring-like revolved bodies should get a real cut-section spin
   attempt before tetra; do not use direct surface-id spin.
9. Component names should describe the physical object, not the mesh type.
   Examples: housing, shaft_ring, spacer_block_upper, support_flange.
10. Do not repair quality by blindly refining the whole mesh. Prefer strategy
    changes, local 3D smoothing/remesh, or sliver-tetra repair. If bad volume
    elements still cannot be fixed, keep them in the model and report them; do
    not delete unfixable quality-failed elements unless the user explicitly asks.
11. Gear, helical gear, or spline teeth are local fine-feature regions. Detect
    them only from true tooth geometry: alternating outer-radius peaks/valleys,
    repeated tooth flanks, twisted helical tooth faces, or explicit tooth/root
    surfaces. Do not treat smooth concentric bearing races, annular grooves, or
    cylindrical outer bands as gears. If exact tooth surface IDs are not known,
    auto-detect the outer gear band only after gear geometry evidence is present.
12. Surface-deviation tetra sizing policy: do not make complex/high-face-count
    solids coarser just because they are complex. Keep the requested nominal
    element size, but allow a smaller minimum element size so small faces,
    fillets, teeth, holes, and chamfers can be captured. Log shell-count guard
    warnings before *tetmesh for crash diagnosis, but do not stop complex solids;
    isolate high-risk tetra solids into separate Phase 3 batches instead.
13. Phase 2 finalization is mandatory. After classification, execute the
    generated finalize Tcl so components are renamed and colored by strategy
    before Phase 3 meshing.

        output_mode: Output classification mode (default 10).
        quality_check: Enable quality check (0=no, 1=yes, default 0).
        quality_threshold: Quality accept threshold (default 10).
        deviation_mode: Deviation check mode (default -2).
        deviation_value: Deviation value when deviation_mode >= 0
            (None → "undefined").
        symmetry_flag: Symmetric mid-surface flag (default 0).
